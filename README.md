**web final portfolio assignment reflection**

Question:Tell us about your process, the challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. 

Answer:
    1.For this final assignment, the biggest challenge was that it was all done in bootstrap, and I had to search the bootstrap library for every change, which took longer time than I expected. 

    2.The second challenge was when I was splitting the page, I got confused and copied the header and footer sections wrong and had to repeat the same changes 3 times. 

    3.A third challenge was that the final html validatorm it always showed that the <section> or <div> was not closed, but I checked several times that it was closed.  There was also a change in the gird of the page when the position of the div was modified, which delayed a lot of time. 

    4.The fourth challenge is the size of the images. I have downloaded 2 different sizes of images, but for some reason when I use <picture>, the code for both sizes in mobile size appears at the same time. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a solution, so I had to delete the <picture >just keep one middle size of image. 

    5.The fifth challenge was that my hamburger menu wouldn't display, even though I checked the code one by one, and finally I searched a few YouTube videos and it turned out that I hadn't protected the js code

    How did I overcome it? I watched the course replay demos several times and took notes on how to increase the width of the banner, how to change the position of the images, and the corresponding timing of the videos, and when I encountered the same problem with my website, I would go back and watch the replay. I will go back and watch the playback when I encounter the same problem on my website and the content of the bright space until I find a solution before I do the next step. 


Question:What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
    
Answer: 
     At first I was torn between listing all my work in the portfolio or linking to it so that people who wanted to see the videos could go to YouTube, those who wanted to see the designs could go to the design page and those who wanted to see the web could go to GitHub. In the end I chose linking to the corresponding links to showcase the work. I also added some personal stuff to the website, such as pictures of my life, interests and hobbies. This way I can present a more three-dimensional picture of me. 

     In the process of building my portfolio, I realised that I still have a lot to learn and that my work is still too small and unstructured and I need to work harder. 
     Another thing I have realised is that a portfolio is a presentation of my image and I am not good enough at creating web pages to support what I want to say, so I need to spend more time practising.
